hmc-scheduler
=============

Here's a tool to help you arrange your classes for next semester. Input the classes you want to take, and it'll tell you which schedules are compatible, if any. It's designed for use with Harvey Mudd College's Portal, but it doesn't have to be used that way. In fact, it can be used for scheduling other things, too! Stores data on the client computer.

Here's [a link to a working version](http://hmc-tools.github.io/hmc-scheduler). Thanks to Alex Ozdemir, Jonathan Chang, and Lisa Yin for improvements!

## Contributions & Maintenance

All the people who worked on this project have graduated, and a new maintaner in needed. Contact Alex if you're interested.

It's a very small project to maintain, and doesn't take much time.
